### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

For approximately 6 years, I have been developing with NestJS.
Additionally, I have experience working with Express, Fastify, React, Next.js, Vue, and Nuxt.js. I have a strong understanding of microservice architecture and hands-on experience migrating monolithic applications to microservices.

I possess extensive experience in integrating with various CRMs, Telegram API, GraphQL API, and WebSocket, as well as developing REST APIs and SOAP APIs.

I have worked with OpenAI API, RAG, and Pinecone (vector data storage, fine-tuning OpenAI models).

I am proficient with Docker and package managers like yarn, npm, and bun.
I can efficiently manage cloud infrastructure on Yandex Cloud and AWS, and I have expertise in designing high-load systems.

My database experience includes PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, ClickHouse, Redis, Memcached, and various ORMs like Sequelize and TypeORM.

For over 3 years, I have been working with Kafka, RabbitMQ, and Mosquitto.
I have a solid ability to understand and analyze other developers' code and substantial experience conducting code reviews.
